Details
-------

This module has many uses, but it is probably most useful when combined with
virtual hosting (although it can be used with almost any configuration
directives or database layouts).

It provides a method for repeating sections with values plugged in from the
results of an SQL query, letting you easily configure an Apache server with
relatively little work.
